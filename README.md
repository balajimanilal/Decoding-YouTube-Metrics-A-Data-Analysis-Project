# Decoding YouTube Metrics: A Data Analysis Project

The project aimed to analyze YouTube data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights regarding viewer engagement, channel performance, and the impact of metadata on video metrics.

1. Data Collection and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualization

**Data Collection and Cleaning:**

* Data from multiple CSV files was collected and concatenated into a single DataFrame.

* Duplicate entries were removed to ensure data accuracy.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* The distribution of likes across different video categories was examined, revealing categories with the highest likes.

* Viewer engagement metrics like rate, dislike rate, and comment count rate were calculated to gauge audience interaction.

**Visualization:**

* Box plots and bar charts were utilized to visualize the distribution of metrics across categories and channels.

* Regression plots and correlation analysis were employed to explore relationships between views, likes, and dislikes.

> **Key Findings**
1. Categories such as Music and Entertainment garnered the highest likes, indicating strong viewer engagement.
2. Certain channels emerged as top performers with the largest number of trending videos.
3. The presence of punctuation in video titles showed a subtle correlation with views and likes, suggesting potential implications for content creators.


**Conclusions:**

The project provides valuable insights into viewer behavior and content performance on YouTube. Data-driven decisions can be made regarding content creation, promotion, and audience engagement strategies. Further analysis could explore additional factors influencing video success, such as video length, upload frequency, and thumbnail design.
